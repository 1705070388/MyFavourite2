        <p>Harboring a passion for books is considered to be a virtue. "Books are uniquely portable magic" said Stephen King a prominent american author. Aliens, monsters, dragons, fairies, witches and wizards, all come alive through stories. Books have the power to transport a reader to a fairyland, in space, a faraway land or in the ocean.

        Reading is always a personal preference. Even in a family, each member may pick a different book while visiting a library or a bookstore. One may wonder why so much emphasis is given to reading. 
          <br>
        1. Reading introduces readers to different ideas and helps them solve their problems.
          <br>
        2. Reading helps people form an opinion about things around them and broadens their perspective.
          <br>
        3. Reading makes one more knowledgeable.
          <br>
        4. It is found that reading fiction books enhances the imagination of the readers. Visualization of the characters and the settings makes them more creative. 
          <br>
        5. Reading books slowly refines one's vocabulary and thoughts. It eventually helps one write better.
          <br>
        6. Reading books keeps one's mind active, strong and healthy.
